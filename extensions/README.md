# OpenHands Extensions

This repository is the **public extensions registry** for [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands).
It contains reusable, shareable skills and plugins that customize agent behavior.

- Skills overview docs: https://docs.openhands.dev/overview/skills
- SDK skill guide: https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/guides/skill

## Repository Layout

### Skills

Skills are Markdown-based guidelines that provide domain-specific knowledge and instructions.
They live under `skills/`, **one directory per skill**:

- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — the skill definition (AgentSkills-style progressive disclosure)
- `skills/<skill-name>/README.md` — optional human-facing notes/examples

Browse the catalog in [`skills/`](skills/).

### Plugins

Plugins are extensions with executable code components (hooks, scripts).
They live under `plugins/`, **one directory per plugin**:

- `plugins/<plugin-name>/SKILL.md` — the plugin definition
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/hooks/` — lifecycle hooks
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/scripts/` — utility scripts

Browse available plugins in [`plugins/`](plugins/).

### NPM Package

This repository also publishes catalog data through the `@openhands/extensions` package. It requires Node.js 18.20.0 or newer because the catalog entry points import JSON modules with import attributes.

```js
import { AUTOMATION_CATALOG, INTEGRATION_CATALOG } from "@openhands/extensions";
import { INTEGRATION_CATALOG as MCP_MARKETPLACE } from "@openhands/extensions/integrations";
import { AUTOMATION_CATALOG as RECOMMENDED_AUTOMATIONS } from "@openhands/extensions/automations";
```

React logo components are isolated behind a separate export so data-only consumers do not need React peer dependencies:

```js
import { INTEGRATION_LOGOS } from "@openhands/extensions/integrations/logos";
```

The package ships the whole repo, so the `skills/`, `plugins/`, and `marketplaces/` trees are available from the installed package. Resolve content files to a path, or import JSON manifests directly:

```js
// .md / .py / etc.: resolve to a path, then read with fs
const skillPath = import.meta.resolve("@openhands/extensions/skills/code-review/SKILL.md");

// .json: import directly
import marketplace from "@openhands/extensions/marketplaces/openhands-extensions.json" with { type: "json" };
```

See [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md), [`automations/README.md`](automations/README.md), and [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) for catalog-specific details.

### Python Package

The integration catalog is also published as a Python package (`openhands-extensions`) so Python services read the same catalog data as JS consumers. The single source of truth is the hand-authored JSON directory `integrations/catalog/<id>.json`; there is no separate provider file and no aggregate catalog JSON to maintain. Both the JS package (`@openhands/extensions/integrations`) and the Python package read those same per-integration JSON files and expose parallel read functions.

Each catalog entry can carry oauth and/or mcp/http `connectionOptions`. `supportsOauth` / `supportsMcp` flags are derived at runtime. Use `listIntegrationCatalog({ mcp, oauth })` (JS) or `list_integration_catalog_models(mcp=, oauth=)` (Python) to filter by connector type - for example only integrations that support an oauth connector.

```python
from openhands_extensions import (
    list_integration_catalog_models,                 # listIntegrationCatalog({ mcp, oauth })
    get_integration_catalog_entry_model,             # getIntegrationCatalogEntry(id)
    INTEGRATION_CATALOG_SNAPSHOT,                    # { integrations }
)

all_integrations = list_integration_catalog_models()
oauth_integrations = list_integration_catalog_models(oauth=True)  # only entries with an oauth connector
mcp_integrations = list_integration_catalog_models(mcp=True)      # only entries with an mcp connector
sample = get_integration_catalog_entry_model(all_integrations[0].id)
```

The Python functions return validated `IntegrationCatalogEntry` models. The raw-dictionary accessors `list_integration_catalog` / `get_integration_catalog_entry` were deprecated in 0.10.0 and removed in 0.12.0; see [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).

Install from git (the hub backend consumes it this way):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions.git
```

The JS and Python versions are kept in lock-step by `release-please` and guarded by `tests/test_version_alignment.py`.
